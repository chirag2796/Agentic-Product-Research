# 🎉 ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE - AI Agent Team for CRM Research

## ✅ **ALL REQUIREMENTS MET**

Your AI Engineer take-home assignment is now **100% complete** with all requirements fulfilled:

### **✅ Framework Requirement**
- **Used**: LangGraph (StateGraph-based orchestration)
- **Alternative**: CrewAI and AutoGen also available
- **Implementation**: Full agentic framework with dynamic routing

### **✅ 4+ Autonomous Agents**
- **7 Agents Total** (exceeds minimum requirement):
  1. **Query Analyzer** - Analyzes natural language business queries
  2. **Research Coordinator** - Plans and coordinates research strategy
  3. **Web Research Specialist** - Gathers real-time data using web search
  4. **Data Analysis Specialist** - Structures and analyzes research data
  5. **Validation Specialist** - Cross-checks findings and ensures accuracy
  6. **Quality Controller** - Performs overall quality assurance
  7. **Report Generation Specialist** - Creates comprehensive comparison reports

### **✅ Dynamic Agent Interaction**
- **Non-linear Flows**: Agents can trigger other agents, loop back for re-validation
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Each agent reasons and responds based on context
- **Dynamic Delegation**: Agents delegate tasks and escalate issues
- **State Sharing**: All agents access shared state for context

### **✅ Natural Language Query Initiation**
- **Exact Query**: "We're evaluating CRM tools. Give me a summarized comparison between HubSpot, Zoho, and Salesforce for small to mid-size B2B businesses. Focus on pricing, features, integrations, and limitations."
- **Query Processing**: Query Analyzer agent processes and extracts requirements
- **Dynamic Response**: System adapts based on query analysis

### **✅ Structured Output**
- **JSON Format**: Structured data with all research findings
- **Markdown Tables**: Side-by-side comparison tables
- **PDF Reports**: Professional formatted documents with timestamps
- **Text Summaries**: Human-readable format

### **✅ 3-Slide Presentation**
- **Slide 1**: What agentic orchestration means
- **Slide 2**: System architecture and agent communication
- **Slide 3**: Trade-offs, assumptions, and future improvements

## 🚀 **How to Run the System**

### **Main System (LangGraph)**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Run the complete agentic system
python main_langgraph.py
```

### **Test the System**
```bash
# Test LangGraph system
python test_langgraph.py

# Test fallback system (no LLM required)
python test_fallback.py
```

## 📊 **System Architecture**

### **LangGraph StateGraph Flow**
```
Query Analyzer → Research Coordinator → Web Researcher
                ↓
Data Analyst ← Validation Agent ← Quality Controller
                ↓
            Report Generator
```

### **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Routing**: Agents decide next steps based on current state
- **State Management**: Shared state across all agents
- **Conditional Edges**: Non-linear workflow with intelligent routing
- **Quality Gates**: Multiple validation checkpoints
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when LLM credits exhausted

## 🎯 **Assignment Requirements Checklist**
